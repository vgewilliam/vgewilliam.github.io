Hello, thanks for visiting my homepage!:clap::clap::clap:

I am Weilian Li, working in the Computational Methods Lab led by [**Prof. Dr.-Ing. Youness Dehbi**](https://www.hcu-hamburg.de/prof-dr-ing-youness-dehbi) at the HafenCity University Hamburg, Germany. 
I received my Ph.D. in Geomatics Science and Technology at Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in December 2020. Then, I finished my postdoc research stay in the Geoinformation Group chaired by [**Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jan-Henrik Haunert**](https://www.geoinfo.uni-bonn.de/en/team/haunert) at the University of Bonn in October 2023.

My research primarily focuses on the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in disaster management, but also methodological expertise in Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in topics related to smart cities, disaster management, and digital twins.

Additionally, I hold the position of Topic Editor at the journal [**Big Earth Data**](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tbed20) and actively contribute to the GIS community as the secretary of the [**ISPRS ICWG III/IVa**](https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/icwg-3-4a/) on Disaster Management and representative of the [**UN-GGIM Academic Network**](https://unggim.academicnetwork.org/members/).

<!-- My research primarily focuses on the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in disaster management. With the guidance of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jan-Henrik Haunert and Prof. Dr.-Ing. Youness Dehbi, I have not only intensified my research in disaster visualization but also expanded my methodological expertise in Machine Learning. I have a strong interest in topics related to smart cities, disaster management, and digital twins. Additionally, I hold the position of Topic Editor at the journal Big Earth Data and serve as a Youth Editorial Board Member for the journal Natural Hazards Research. Furthermore, I actively contribute to the field as the secretary of the ISPRS Working Group ICWG III/IVa on Disaster Management and representative of the UN-GGIM Academic Network.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
